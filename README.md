# JSON Local Pretty Print Bookmarklet

## What does it do?
Formats JSON on the page to make it easier to read in the browser (e.g. if I'm looking at /my-awesome-api-endpoint or somefile.json).
Mainly I've used this in Chrome when it's controlled by an administrator that doesn't permit installing extensions.

## Why?
In cases where your browser is controlled by an administrator and you can't install any extensions or use a browser that has lovely built-in JSON formatting, sometimes reading through a JSON response can be kind of a pain.
Purpose of this to try to make it a little easier to look at the JSON on the page instead of digging through response the network tab.

## Setup
1. Copy the contents of bookmarklet.js or bookmarklet.min.js
2. Go to your browser's bookmarks options and add a new bookmark.
3. Enter the bookmark name as your preferred name for the bookmarklet.
4. In the URL field, paste the contents of bookmarklet.js or bookmarklet.min.js
5. Save the bookmark

## Usage
In the browser go to the JSON endpoint or open the JSON file you want to look at and the click the bookmarklet.
